            <h3>Mix</h3> 
        
            Combine your dry ingredients (flour, sugar, salt, baking powder) in one bowl and your wet ingredients (egg, milk, vegetable oil, mashed bananas) in another bowl.
            <br>
            Add the dry ingredients to the bowl with the wet ingredients, then stir until they're incorporated. 
            It's OK if your batter is slightly lumpy. 
        </li>
        <li>
           <h3>Cook</h3>

            Pour the batter in Â¼ cup portions onto a lightly oiled pan or griddle over medium-high heat. 
            <br>
            Cook for a few minutes, flip with a spatula, and cook for another few minutes (or until each side is golden brown). 
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Serve</h3>

            Serve your banana pancakes immediately. 
            They're delicious alone or with your favorite pancake toppings.
